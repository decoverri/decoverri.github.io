		<section class="about">
			<p>I'm mostly driven by knowledge. Not only from book,s but from experiences. And it always felt natural to me to pass it on afterwards. For that, I constantly try to better understand the flows of thinking.</p>
			<p>I work as a software developer and instructor at <a href="http://caelum.com.br">Caelum</a>, in both Java and Front-end classes. I've worked as a financial consultant, technical analysis at an asset management and I've lectured classes at <a href="http://www.poli.usp.br/">Escola Polit√©cnica</a>, apart from being a particular teacher almost all my life. I'm graduated in Applied Mathematics at <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/">IME-USP</a>.

				<dd>As a RPG enthusiast, but with little free time to play it, it annoyed me the time spent to roll treasures for the game encounters. So I decided to automate the process. It emulates the same algorithm from the books, with just a few clicks. It also became my pet project for studying new technologies.</dd>
